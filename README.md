This project is a JavaFX-based system which uses an H2 database to allow students to ask and delete questions 

To set up the project, first clone the repository using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/2dcreator/IndividualAssignment2.git
Then navigate into the project directory:
then you can directly run it in Eclipse
You can also download the zip file, and import it into Eclipse, but if you on Windows you will have to make sure to unzip the file before it runs properly
(One thing to note is if it does not run initially you may have to check the Run Configurations, and within the FoundationCode navigate to Arguments and make sure the first
box is unchecked)
Once you get into the project you can use any password or username, as I just rebuilt upon the original foundation code
